The mobile app development report: obstacles, mistakes, and key takeaways.

The introduction is important.
A Kotlin-based mobile app was developed for movie browsing and seat selection. The experience provided invaluable lessons, even though we encountered several challenges and made some mistakes. An overview of our journey is presented below.

There are challenges

    Obtaining accurate movie details from sources like Vue posed significant challenges when it came to obtaining movie information.
    Implementing a random seat selection technique proved to be particularly challenging.
    Aligning the app's design with our vision proved to be more complex than we anticipated.
    The integration of authentic movie images and proper font usage presented unexpected difficulties.

There were errors.

    Our approach to managing movie data was flawed, which led to operational issues.
    Preventing users from selecting unauthorized seats required multiple attempts to get right.
    Design skepticism: The initial app concept fell short of our intended vision.

The most important lessons learned.

    We honed our techniques for arranging and utilizing movie data efficiently.
    The seat selection process was optimized to enhance the user experience.
    Finding and incorporating design feedback helped us better align the app with our original idea.
    Getting more experience made it easier to integrate movie clips and pick the right fonts.

The conclusion was:
There were challenges and errors when developing this app. However, by acknowledging our mistakes and actively seeking feedback, we were able to create an improved app that delivers a better user experience.
